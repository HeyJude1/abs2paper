VI. CONCLUSION
This work introduces the CCSS, an extension of the CSS for uniform hypergraphs, to compactly nonuniform hypergraphs. A novel memoization-based algorithm CCSS-MEMO adapted from the generating function approach is proposed to compute S 3 TTVC on the blowup adjacency tensor of non-uniform hypergraphs. We demonstrate the performance of our shared-memory parallel CCSS-MEMO by comparing it to two naive baseline algorithms using the CCSS -CCSS-DIRECT and CCSS-FFT -for multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. In the future, we plan to explore distributedmemory construction of CCSS and distributed-memory parallel S 3 TTVC computation using CCSS-MEMO. Furthermore, we plan to utilize CCSS-MEMO as the computational kernel in extending multilinear PageRank to nonuniform hypergraphs, where we anticipate its advanced data structures and parallelization will allow analysis of datasets previously considered prohibitively large for tensor analysis. Our fast algorithm would also help facilitate the multilinear hypergraph clustering . Moreover, we believe it opens the door for development of tensor-based methods for semi-supervised and supervised hypergraph learning tasks such as node classification and link prediction. . We set the time limit of our jobs at 50 minutes for all thread configurations. The stackoverflow dataset does not complete within the allotted time for 1, 2 and 4 thread configurations for CCSS-DIRECT. . We see that CCSS achieves more compact storage than the coordinate format i.e. storing the adjacency tensor non-zeros as lists of index tuples along with their non-zero value.
