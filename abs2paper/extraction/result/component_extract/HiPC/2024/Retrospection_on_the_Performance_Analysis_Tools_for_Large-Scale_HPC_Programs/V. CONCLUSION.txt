V. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we presented a comprehensive study of performance analysis tools for large-scale HPC systems. We identified the key features of performance analysis tools and evaluated the performance analysis tools based on these features. We provided a detailed comparison of the performance analysis tools based on their features and capabilities. We found that the performance analysis tools have different features and capabilities, and they are suitable for different types of applications. We also found that the performance analysis tools have different levels of support for large-scale HPC systems. We believe that our study will help researchers and practitioners to choose the right performance analysis tools for their applications.
