V. RELATED WORK
Due to the high potential performance benefits of its use, GPU shared memory has been a topic of several recent efforts regarding OpenMP offload. Huber et al. describe how recent versions of the LLVM/OpenMP runtime examine variables and determine placement, including use of shared memory where safe and appropriate . Gammelmark et al. show how programs can be structured to allow the compiler to infer that GPU shared memory can be used, in the absence of explicit annotations. Talaashrafi et al. show how the OpenMP runtime library can in some cases automatically make use of GPU shared memory.
Although we focus on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs in this study, TestSNAP can also run on Intel GPUs . Testing our use of LLVM/OpenMP extensions in the Kokkos-OpenMP backend on Intel GPUs is a topic for future work, as upstream LLVM does not currently support OpenMP offload for them. Kokkos is one of several C++ performance portability frameworks. Others, such as RAJA , may also benefit from LLVM-OpenMP extensions using techniques similar to ours. Additionally, since the OpenMP API also supports Fortran, eventual inclusion of the extensions in the specification would also benefit programmers in that language, which currently has few performance portable options besides OpenMP offload.
