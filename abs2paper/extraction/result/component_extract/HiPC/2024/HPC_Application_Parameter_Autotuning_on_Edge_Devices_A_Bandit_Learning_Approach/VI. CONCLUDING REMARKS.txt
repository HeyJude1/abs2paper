VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper, we introduce LASP, a novel and lightweight autotuning approach for dynamic configuration in resourceconstrained edge systems. LASP stands out due to two key enhancements: firstly, it possesses the ability to learn and predict the configuration space in real-time, adapting swiftly to environmental changes. Secondly, it offers customization in optimizing both execution time and power consumption. To assess its effectiveness and efficiency, we conducted extensive experiments on four well-known HPC applications: Lulesh, Kripke, Clomp, and Hypre, each under varying settings. The results consistently demonstrated that LASP achieved a positive cumulative performance gain in dynamic workload scenarios. This capability is particularly beneficial for leveraging edge devices as proxies to perform the costly autotuning process. Our findings emphasize LASP's suitability for parameter tuning tasks, especially in environments where workloads frequently change.
