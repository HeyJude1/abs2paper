6 RELATED WORK
CML frameworks and libraries can be divided into three categories.
(1) General-purpose solution uses one framework to support various models. Scikit-learn is the most widely used CML framework on GitHub . Spark MLlib is an extension to Spark . H2O uses MapReduce to support both CML and DL. There are many other works, such as Shogun and RapidMiner . These frameworks only support CPU, suffering from severe performance and portability issues. (2) Specific-purpose solution focuses on one type of model. LibLinear supports logistic regression and linear SVM. LibSVM focuses on SVMs. These works are limited to CPUs. Some other works attempt to support various hardware devices. XGBoost implements a gradient-boosting decision tree algorithm on CPUs and GPUs. Muhsen Owaida et al. bring XGBoost to FPGAs. Toby Sharp implements decision trees and forests on GPUs. These frameworks only support a narrowed variety of models and solve the problem of portability to a certain extent.
(3) Extension based on DL attempts to utilize DL frameworks to support CML models. TF-DF is a decision forest library based on TensorFlow but is limited to CPUs. It's implemented ad-hoc, losing the portability of DL frameworks. Hummingbird is a general-purpose solution based on PyTorch, adding support for GPUs. They utilize those abstractions in DL frameworks directly without digging into the features of CML, missing many optimization chances.
