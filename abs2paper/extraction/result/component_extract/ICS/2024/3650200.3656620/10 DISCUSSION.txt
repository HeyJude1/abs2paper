10 DISCUSSION
MEATTEN has currently implemented support for 128-bit NEON on ARMv8 platforms. However, its technologies can be easily ported to other platforms, including the ARM Scalable Vector Extension (SVE) and the Intel AVX-512 SIMD extension. This entails deriving tiling parameters, such as b1, b2, and b3, specific to the architecture using our analytical model and rewriting micro-kernels with assembly. Our parallelism approach is applicable for accelerating the commonly used batched matrix-multiplication workload in deep learning. Furthermore, MEATTEN is advantageous for compiler frameworks like TVM, as the fused SDPA operator provided by MEATTEN can be utilized as a backend for aggressive low-level optimizations. This paper introduces MEATTEN, an open-source library optimizing self-attention performance on ARMv8 multi-cores. MEATTEN presents innovations in loop optimization, micro-kernel design, and parallel algorithms for the attention operator. We conduct performance evaluations for single operators and end-to-end inference. The results indicate that MEATTEN achieves highly competitive performance across various platforms, thread counts, batch sizes, and sequence lengths.
