5 CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose an enhanced BFS algorithm, which requires 𝑂 (𝐸 𝑤𝑐𝑐 (𝑖)) and 𝑂 (𝑆 𝑤𝑐𝑐 • 𝐸 𝑤𝑐𝑐 ) time for solving SSSP and APSP problems on the unweighted graph, respectively.
Our research involved a performance evaluation of DAWN, GAP, and Gunrock across various platforms, using graphs from SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and Gunrock benchmark dataset. DAWN achieves average speedup of 3.769× and 9.410×, over GAP and Gunrock respectively.
The experiment underscores that DAWN based on the SOVM, exhibits remarkable scalability and efficiency in addressing the shortest paths problem on modern processors. The efficient utilization of computational resources is a significant factor contributing to its exceptional performance. These results highlight the potential of DAWN as a powerful tool for graph analytics, particularly in applications that require high processing speed and efficiency.
Our future research will focus on addressing the balance between optimizing matrix operations and managing the consumption of (min,+) operations. This focus is aimed to expand the applicability of DAWN on weighted graphs, transforming it from a promising proof-of-concept to a practical tool that can be used in various real-world graph analysis applications in the future.
