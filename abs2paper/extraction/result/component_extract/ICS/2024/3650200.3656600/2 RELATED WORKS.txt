2 RELATED WORKS
The shortest paths problem is a classic problem in graph theory and network science. In this section, we introduce the typical algorithms for solving the SSSP and APSP problems.
In addition, we will introduce several APSP algorithms based on matrix multiplication.
2.1 SSSP algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is a common SSSP algorithm , and the main optimization methods are priority queue of binary heap and Fibonacci heap . Meyer et al. proposed an optimized Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a parallel version for a large class of graphs . The best parallel version of the Δ-stepping Dijkstra's algorithm takes 𝑂 (𝐷 • 𝐿 • log 𝑛 + log 2 𝑛) time and 𝑂 (𝑛 +𝑚 + 𝐷 • 𝐿 • log 𝑛) work on average, where 𝐿 denotes the maximum shortest paths weight from the source node (𝑠) to any node reachable from 𝑠, and 𝐷 represents the maximum node degree .
2.2 BFS Algorithm
Scott Beamer et al. proposed a hybrid BFS algorithm that combines a conventional top-down approach with a novel bottom-up approach . In the top-down approach, nodes within the active frontier seek unvisited child nodes, whereas in the bottom-up approach, unvisited nodes seek parents within the active frontier. Scott Beamer et al. further optimized the performance of direction-optimized BFS in various application scenarios , ultimately integrating it into GAP (Graph Algorithm Platform benchmark Suite). GAP is a portable high-performance baseline which includes representative implementations of state-of-the-art performance, and is intended to help graph processing research by standardizing evaluations .
Julian Shun and Laxman Dhulipala et al. inspired by the direction-optimized BFS algorithm, achieve close to the same efficiency (time and space) as the optimized BFS of Beamer et. al. and using a much simpler implementation code . Further, they promoted widespread applications of this optimization approach and constructed a high-performance computing framework called GBBS (Graph Based Benchmark Suite) which based on the Ligra/Ligra+/Julienne graph processing frameworks , including betweenness centrality, graph radius estimation, graph connectivity, PageRank and single-source shortest paths etc..
2.3 Matrix algorithm
The shortest paths algorithm based on matrix squaring multiplication has received extensive attention . The matrix squaring multiplication algorithm reduces the number of matrix multiplications from 𝑛 to log 𝑛, but it requires storing many intermediate matrices. When the graph is large, the algorithm needs to consume a significant amount of space.
Seidel's algorithm is the APSP algorithm based on matrix multiplication , which is suitable for unweighted undirected graphs and time complexity is 𝑂 (log 𝑛 • 𝑛 𝜔 ). The Seidel's algorithm requires numerous memory to maintain intermediate matrices, due to reduce the time complexity of GEMM (General Matrix-Matrix multiplication) via divideand-conquer strategy .
Arlazarov et al. proposed the APSP algorithm based on the boolean matrix multiplication on the unweighted graphs , which has alleviated the issue of excessive memory requirements associated with matrix multiplication-based APSP algorithms to a limited extent.
