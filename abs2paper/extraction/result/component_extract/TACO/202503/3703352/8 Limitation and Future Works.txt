8 Limitation and Future Works
Our research focuses on accelerating SpGEMM multiplication for high-dimensional, large-scale matrices, but there are still some limitations and room for future improvement. On one hand, in GPU memory, ApSpGEMM requires additional space to maintain the "rowind" list until panel computation is complete. On the other hand, while optimizing memory access, we reduce the overhead of threads reading NZs from global memory to shared memory, but we do not reduce the overhead of writing the temporary product results from shared memory back to global memory. In the future, we need to design a compressed storage format that can map new matrix and original matrix information to replace CSR. Additionally, by predicting the NZs in the temporary product, we can preallocate storage space in global memory to write temporary product results in batches.
