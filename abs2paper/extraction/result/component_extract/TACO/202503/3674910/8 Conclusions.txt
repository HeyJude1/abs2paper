8 Conclusions
We present MobiRL, a reinforcement learning-based frequency scheduler for mobile systems. MobiRL autonomously learns to schedule CPU and GPU frequency for better UI smoothness and lower power consumption. Experiments on a newly released smartphone show that MobiRL outperforms the scheduler in off-the-shelf mobile smartphones. Mobile systems are everywhere now. We think our work can be valuable for system designers. Moreover, we advocate applying ML/AI techniques for OS, and optimizations can be an ideal approach for system performance. This project is supported by a well-known mobile phone company, and MobiRL has been used in mobile phone products.
