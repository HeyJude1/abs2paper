3 Performance Decline of PCFR+ in the Presence of Dominated Actions
Although PCFR+ successfully employs prediction to significantly accelerate convergence, we show that its performance deteriorates notably when facing dominated actions. Consider a 2 × 2 zero-sum normal-form game NFG (2), represented by max x∈∆ 2 min y∈∆ 2 x T U y, where U = ((1, 0) , (0, 2)) is

Iterations (×10 3 ) player 1's utility matrix. As shown in the left plot of Figure , PCFR+ converges extremely faster than other CFR variants, benefiting from prediction during strategy updates. However, when we introduce a dominated action for each player, resulting in NFG (3), where U = ((1, 0, 5) , (0, 2, 0) , (0, 0, 100)), PCFR+'s performance declines greatly as depicted in the right plot. For player 2, action 3 is dominated by action 1, allowing its elimination. Thus, player 1's action 3 can also be eliminated. Consequently, NFG (3) reduces to NFG (2), with the NE x = y = 2 3 , 1 3 , 0 . After the first iteration of PCFR+, player 2 has cumulative regrets R 1 = 100 3 , 100 3 , 0 . The substantial loss of action 3 leads to high cumulative regrets for player 2's actions 1 and 2, making it challenging to distinguish between these two actions. Due to the small instantaneous regrets per iteration, PCFR+ requires about 1500 iterations to achieve a 2:1 cumulative regrets for actions 1 and 2, producing an approximate NE.

While LinearCFR and DCFR initially converge faster than PCFR+ in NFG (3) by assigning more weights to recent iterations and alleviating high regrets from earlier iterations, PCFR+ leverages predictions to surpass them after 2000 iterations. It will be a best-of-both-worlds algorithm if we design a CFR variant that not only allocates more weights to recent iterations but also employs predictions to compute a new strategy, therefore greatly speeding up convergence.
