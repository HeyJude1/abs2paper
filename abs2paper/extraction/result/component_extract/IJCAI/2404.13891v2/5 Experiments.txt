5 Experiments
In this section, we briefly describe testing games, compare PDCFR+ with other CFR variants, and analyze PDCFR+'s superior performance on normal-form games.
5.1 Testing Games
We use several commonly used IIGs in the research community and provide brief descriptions below. For more details, please refer to the Appendix B. Kuhn Poker is a simplified poker with a three-card deck and one chance to bet for each player. Leduc Poker is a larger game with a 6-card deck and two betting rounds. In Liar's Dice (x) (x=4, 5) , each player gets an xsided dice, which they roll at the start and take turn placing bets on the outcome. Goofspiel (x) (x=4, 5) is a card game where each player has x cards and aims to score points by bidding simultaneously in x rounds. GoofspielImp (x) (x=4, 5) is a imperfect variant of Goofspiel (x), where bid cards remain unrevealed. In Battleship (x) (x=2, 3) , players secretly position a 1 × 2 ship on separate 2 × x grids and take turns firing at the opponent's ship three times. HUNL Subgame (x) (x=3, 4) is a heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em (HUNL) subgame generated by the top poker agent Libratus .
The testing games selected exhibit diverse structures and considerable game sizes, presenting a nontrivial challenge to solve. However, their complexity remains manageable for an algorithm to complete within two weeks, rendering them highly suitable for evaluating algorithmic performance. When extending to larger games, we can capitalize on a variety of well-established techniques, such as abstraction, decomposition , and subgame-solving . These approaches effectively mitigate the increased complexity associated with scaling up the size of the games.
5.2 Convergence Results
We compare PDCFR+ with CFR+, LinearCFR, DCFR, PCFR+ and DCFR+ across twelve games. For DCFR, we adopt the hyperparameters suggested by the authors, specifically α = 1.5, β = 0, and γ = 2. Regarding DCFR+ and PDCFR+, according to Theorems 3 and 4, α and γ must ensure that { τt wt } t≤T forms a positive, non-increasing sequence. However, in practice, we find that the range of values for α and γ can be larger, and they generally yield good convergence results. Based on these observations, for DCFR+, we set α = 1.5 and γ = 4 following , which is automatically set by an evolutionary search algorithm. We perform a coarse grid search to fine-tune the hyperparameters for PDCFR+, and the best one, i.e., α = 2.3 and γ = 5, is then used across all games. All algorithms utilize the alternating-updates technique.
We run each algorithm for 20,000 iterations in each testing game to observe their long-term behavior, with Figure displaying exploitability curves. We set a minimum reachable exploitability of 10 −12 , denoting the point where the average strategy profile is considered sufficiently converged to a NE. Across non-poker games (Goofspiel, Battleship, Liar's Dice), PDCFR+ outperforms others by 4-8 orders of magnitude, taking 2,000-12,000 iterations to achieve the minimum reachable exploitability. For poker games, PDCFR+ excels in Kuhn Poker. In Leduc Poker, PDCFR+ initially lags behind DCFR and CFR+ up to 10,000 iterations but exhibits faster convergence thereafter. In the large-scale poker game HUNL Subgame, PDCFR+ performs comparably to CFR+ and PCFR+, while DCFR+ emerges as the fastest algorithm. In summary, PDCFR+ stands as an improved version of PCFR+, with a similar property for excellence in non-poker games.
PDCFR+ employs γ = 5 in the computation of average strategies, while PCFR+ utilizes quadratic averaging, equivalent to γ = 2 in PDCFR+. In order to assess whether PD-CFR+'s improved performance is solely attributable to its specific averaging of strategies, we present the performance of PCFR+ (5), which employs γ = 5, in Figure . PCFR+ (5) outperforms PCFR+ with quadratic averaging in nine games. PDCFR+ performs similarly to PCFR+ (5) in six games but exhibits significantly faster convergence in five games. Particularly in GoofSpiel (5) and Liar's Dice (5), PDCFR+ surpasses PCFR+ (5) by 5-7 orders of magnitude. Thus, we conclude that the acceleration observed in PDCFR+ is not solely a result of using a more aggressive weighting scheme for determining average strategies but is also attributed to the weighting scheme employed in determining regrets.
To further comprehend the enhanced performance of PD-CFR+, consider the normal-form games NFG (2) and NFG
(3) discussed in section 3. Top plots of Figure show that PDCFR+ converges extremely fast on both games, not affected by the dominated actions. After the first iteration of PDCFR+ in NFG (3), player 2 has high cumulative regrets R 1 = 100 3 , 100 3 , 0 due to the dominated action 3. As shown in the bottom-right plot of Figure , PDCFR+ rapidly discounts cumulative regrets, and at around the 200th iteration, it has already learned stable 2:1 cumulative regrets for actions 1 and 2, producing an approximate NE. In contrast, PCFR+ is still struggling with fluctuations and requires much more iterations to approach a NE. This highlights PDCFR+'s ability to swiftly mitigate the negative effects of dominated actions and consistently leverage predictions to accelerate convergence.
