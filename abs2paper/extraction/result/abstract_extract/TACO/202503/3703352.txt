摘要：The Sparse General Matrix-Matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a fundamental component for many applications, such as algebraic multigrid methods (AMG), graphic processing, and deep learning. However, the unbearable latency of computing high-dimensional, large-scale sparse matrix multiplication on GPUs hinders the development of these applications. An effective approach is heterogeneous cores collaborative computing, but this method must address three aspects: (1) irregular non-zero elements lead to load imbalance and irregular memory access, (2) different core computing latency differences reduce computational parallelism, and (3) temporary data transfer between different cores introduces additional latency overhead. In this work, we propose an innovative framework for collaborative large-scale sparse matrix multiplication on CPU-GPU heterogeneous cores, named ApSpGEMM. ApSpGEMM is based on sparsity rules and proposes reordering and splitting algorithms to eliminate the impact of non-zero element distribution features on load and memory access. Then adaptive panels allocation with affinity constraints among cores improves computational parallelism. Finally, carefully arranged asynchronous data transmission and computation balance communication overhead. Compared with state-of-the-art SpGEMM methods, our approach provides excellent absolute performance on matrices with different sparse structures. On heterogeneous cores, the GFlops of large-scale sparse matrix multiplication is improved by 2.25 to 7.21 times.
