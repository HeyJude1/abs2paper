摘要：Sparse-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the performance bottleneck of many high-performance and deep-learning applications, making it attractive to design specialized SpMM hardware accelerators. Unfortunately, existing hardware solutions do not take full advantage of data reuse opportunities of the input and output matrices or suffer from irregular memory access patterns. Their strategies increase the off-chip memory traffic and bandwidth pressure, leaving much room for improvement. We present Mentor, a new approach to designing SpMM accelerators. Our key insight is that column-wise dataflow, while rarely exploited in prior works, can address these issues in SpMM computations. Mentor is a software-hardware co-design approach for leveraging column-wise dataflow to improve data reuse and regular memory accesses of SpMM. On the software level, Mentor incorporates a novel streaming construction scheme to preprocess the input matrix for enabling a streaming access pattern. On the hardware level, it employs a fully pipelined design to unlock the potential of column-wise dataflow further. The design of Mentor is underpinned by a carefully designed analytical model to find the tradeoff between performance and hardware resources. We have implemented an FPGA prototype of Mentor. Experimental results show that Mentor achieves speedup by geomean 2.05× (up to 3.98×), reduces the memory traffic by geomean 2.92× (up to 4.93×), and improves bandwidth utilization by geomean 1.38× (up to 2.89×), compared with the state-of-the-art hardware solutions.
