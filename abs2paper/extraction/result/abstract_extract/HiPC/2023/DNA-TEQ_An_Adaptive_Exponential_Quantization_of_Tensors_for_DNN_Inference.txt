摘要：Quantization is commonly used in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to reduce the storage and computational complexity by decreasing the arithmetical precision of activations and weights, a.k.a. tensors. Efficient hardware architectures employ linear quantization to enable the deployment of recent DNNs onto embedded systems and mobile devices. However, linear uniform quantization cannot usually reduce the numerical precision to less than 8 bits without sacrificing high performance in terms of model accuracy. The performance loss is due to the fact that tensors do not follow uniform distributions. In this paper, we show that a significant amount of tensors fit into an exponential distribution. Then, we propose DNA-TEQ to exponentially quantize DNN tensors with an adaptive scheme that achieves the best trade-off between numerical precision and accuracy loss. The experimental results show that DNA-TEQ provides a much lower quantization bit-width compared to previous proposals, resulting in an average compression ratio of 40% over the linear INT8 baseline, with negligible accuracy loss and without retraining the DNNs. Besides, DNA-TEQ leads the way in performing dot-product operations in the exponential domain. On average for a set of widely used DNNs, DNA-TEQ provides 1.5x speedup and 2.5x energy savings over a baseline DNN accelerator based on 3D-stacked memory.
