摘要：As diverse high-performance computing (HPC) systems are built, many opportunities arise for applications to solve larger problems than ever before. Given the significantly increased complexity of these HPC systems and application tuning, empirical performance tuning, such as autotuning, has emerged as a promising approach in recent years. Despite its effectiveness, autotuning is often a computationally expensive approach. Transfer learning (TL)-based autotuning seeks to address this issue by leveraging the data from prior tuning. Current TL methods for autotuning spend significant time modeling the relationship between parameter configurations and performance, which is ineffective for fewshot (that is, few empirical evaluations) tuning on new tasks. We introduce the first generative TL-based autotuning approach based on the Gaussian copula (GC) to model the high-performing regions of the search space from prior data and then generate high-performing configurations for new tasks. This allows a sampling-based approach that maximizes
