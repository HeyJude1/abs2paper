<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Large language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable advances in automated task-solving with multi-agent systems. However, most existing LLM-based multiagent approaches rely on predefined agents to handle simple tasks, limiting the adaptability of multi-agent collaboration to different scenarios. Therefore, we introduce AutoAgents, an innovative framework that adaptively generates and coordinates multiple specialized agents to build an AI team according to different tasks. Specifically, AutoAgents couples the relationship between tasks and roles by dynamically generating multiple required agents based on task content and planning solutions for the current task based on the generated expert agents. Multiple specialized agents collaborate with each other to efficiently accomplish tasks. Concurrently, an observer role is incorporated into the framework to reflect on the designated plans and agents' responses and improve upon them. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that AutoAgents generates more coherent and accurate solutions than the existing multi-agent methods. This underscores the significance of assigning different roles to different tasks and of team cooperation, offering new perspectives for tackling complex tasks. The repository of this project is available at https://github.com/Link-AGI/AutoAgents.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>LLM-based Autonomous Agents. LLMs have been widely used as core controllers for autonomous agents that can accomplish specific objectives. Auto-GPT <ref type="bibr" coords="2,347.54,713.51,16.73,8.64" target="#b9">[10]</ref> is an early work that leverages an Figure <ref type="figure" coords="3,137.00,433.42,3.95,8.64">1</ref>: A schematic diagram of AutoAgents. The system takes the user input as a starting point and generates a set of specialized agents for novel writing, along with a corresponding execution plan. The agents collaboratively carry out the tasks according to the plan and produce the final novel. Meanwhile, an observer monitors the generation and execution of the Agents and the plan, ensuring the quality and coherence of the process.</p><p>LLM as an AI agent that can autonomously achieve a given goal with the help of several tools. However, Auto-GPT does not support multi-agent collaboration and can only work in isolation. One way to enhance the task-solving capabilities of LLMs is to assign different roles and responsibilities to multiple LLMs and let them coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal. For example, BabyAGI <ref type="bibr" coords="3,149.79,560.79,16.73,8.64" target="#b19">[20]</ref> is an AI-powered task management system with multiple LLM-based agents. One agent creates new tasks based on the previous task's objective and result, another agent prioritizes the task list, and another agent completes tasks. BabyAGI is a multi-agent system with a fixed order of agent communication. MetaGPT <ref type="bibr" coords="3,280.65,593.51,16.73,8.64" target="#b11">[12]</ref> is a multi-agent framework for assigning different roles to GPTs to form a collaborative software entity for complex tasks. It is a specialized LLMbased multi-agent framework for collaborative software development. Camel <ref type="bibr" coords="3,416.97,615.33,16.59,8.64" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is an LLM-based communicative agent framework that demonstrates how role-playing can be used to enable chat agents to communicate with each other for task completion. However, Camel does not support tool-using. Several recent works <ref type="bibr" coords="3,236.82,648.06,15.65,8.64" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,254.88,648.06,7.42,8.64" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,264.70,648.06,12.40,8.64" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,279.51,648.06,12.40,8.64" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,294.32,648.06,12.40,8.64" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="3,309.13,648.06,13.21,8.64" target="#b14">15]</ref> have enhanced the task-solving capabilities of LLMs by integrating multi-agent discussion. For instance, <ref type="bibr" coords="3,339.41,658.97,16.47,8.64" target="#b33">[34]</ref> proposes a multi-agent debate system that allows LLMs to argue for or against a given claim and generate a debate summary. <ref type="bibr" coords="3,453.19,669.88,11.48,8.64" target="#b6">[7]</ref> introduce a multi-agent dialogue system that enables LLMs to exchange information and opinions on a given topic and generate a dialogue report. AutoGen <ref type="bibr" coords="3,296.15,691.70,16.61,8.64" target="#b36">[37]</ref> is a framework that enables the development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. However, most of these multi-agent systems rely on handcrafted or user-specified agents with specific roles Agent Generalization. Several studies <ref type="bibr" coords="4,264.44,427.43,15.66,8.64" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="4,282.25,427.43,13.21,8.64" target="#b34">35]</ref> employ LLMs to generate agents for social simulacra and epidemic modeling, demonstrating how this technique can facilitate designers in assessing and improving their modeling designs prior to deploying them to real users. Likewise, ExpertPrompting <ref type="bibr" coords="4,123.08,460.16,16.52,8.64" target="#b37">[38]</ref> devised a method to generate diverse profiles of agents that can cooperate with human users to accomplish tasks with minimal supervision. However, this method still depends on a restricted set of predefined agents, and the generated agents vary only in their profiles. Recently, SSP <ref type="bibr" coords="4,487.27,481.98,16.73,8.64" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and AgentVerse <ref type="bibr" coords="4,174.29,492.89,11.66,8.64" target="#b4">[5]</ref> have proposed frameworks for automatically generating unlimited agents. SSP enables LLMs to generate agents for problem input by providing some agent samples, and has these agents solve the problem. AgentVerse generates the execution plan through the generated agents' discussions and adds evaluation strategies for cyclic execution. Unlike the previous two methods, AutoAgents places a heightened emphasis on the reliability of its generated agents and strategic plans, thereby enhancing task execution effect through the utilization of collaborative refinement actions and the integration of self-refinement actions , as illustrated in Table <ref type="table" coords="4,382.09,558.34,3.74,8.64">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The Framework for Automatic Agent Generation</head><p>To enhance the effectiveness of autonomous multi-agent groups in accomplishing their goals, the process of AutoAgents consists of two critical stages: Drafting Stage and Execution Stage, as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="4,192.78,658.97,3.81,8.64" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. The drafting stage synthesizes an agent team and an execution plan that are customized to the task by analyzing the input problem or task. The execution stage refines the plan by enabling inter-agent collaboration and feedback, and delivers the final result. The interagent collaboration is based on some principles of multi-agent cooperation, such as communication, coordination, and consensus. These principles help the agents to share information, align their actions, reach agreements, and adapt to the environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Drafting Stage</head><p>Empirical evidence <ref type="bibr" coords="5,191.45,95.45,16.73,8.64" target="#b35">[36]</ref> suggests that diversity within human groups fosters diverse perspectives, which enhances the group's performance across various tasks. The drafting stage, which determines the composition of a multi-agent group, plays a crucial role in setting the upper limits of the group's capabilities. Therefore, it is imperative to generate the optimal agent team and execution plan that can maximize the group's potential.</p><p>Predominant methodologies <ref type="bibr" coords="5,227.74,155.48,15.89,8.64" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,247.61,155.48,12.50,8.64" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,264.09,155.48,13.35,8.64" target="#b36">37]</ref> for assigning role descriptions to autonomous agents rely heavily on human intuition and prior knowledge, requiring manual assignment based on task understanding. Consistent with several parallel findings <ref type="bibr" coords="5,336.42,177.30,15.89,8.64" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,354.82,177.30,12.50,8.64" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="5,369.83,177.30,7.27,8.64" target="#b4">5]</ref>, dynamically designing agents with different roles can significantly enhance their efficacy. However, the scalability and rationality of agent and plan generation are still unclear, especially in the face of various complex problem environments.</p><p>On the one hand, the generated agents should exhibit diversity to accommodate various tasks. On the other hand, the agent and the plan generation should adhere to certain principles, rendering their role allocation more rational. Therefore, we devise three artificially predefined agents to produce agent teams and execution plans, integrating artificial prior knowledge and the dynamic adaptation capability of LLMs to generate more sensible agent teams and execution plans. The three artificially predefined agents comprise Planner, Agent Observer, and Plan Observer:</p><p>• Planner P generates and refines an agent team and an execution plan based on the content of the task. • Agent Observer O agent provides suggestions on the rationality of the agent team members and their matching degree with the task. • Plan Observer O plan provides suggestions on the rationality of the execution plan and its matching degree with the task and the agent team.</p><p>The Planner generates initial agent team members and a specific plan, and improves the agent team and execution plan based on continuous communication with the Agent Observer and Plan Observer.</p><p>Agent Generation. The Planner generates the agent team and facilitates its continuous improvement through reciprocal communication with the Agent Observer. To enable Planner to produce rational agents, we have devised a standard format for the essential elements of a single agent. For each agent A = {P, D, T, S}, the Planner needs to specify its prompt P, description D, toolset T, and suggestions S.</p><p>• Prompt P provides a detailed and customized depiction of the expert identity for each specific agent, which comprises profile, goal, and constraints. Profile reflects the domain expertise of the role or job title. Goal indicates the primary responsibility or objective that the role aims to achieve. Constraints specify limitations or principles the role must adhere to when performing actions. • Description D gives additional concrete identity to help establish a more comprehensive role, develop an execution plan, and inspect problems. • Toolset T equips the Agent with tools that it can use, selected from a predefined set of tools.</p><p>The rationale for not using all the tools for each agent here is to prevent decision-making confusion caused by excessive tools. • Suggestions S supplies some suggestions for each agent to execute the current task, including but not limited to a clear output, extraction of historical information, and suggestions for execution steps.</p><p>Based on the agent list {A 1 , A 2 , • • • , A n } generated by Planner, the Agent Observer evaluates the quality and suitability of each agent. The Agent Observer first verifies whether every agent conforms to the aforementioned specifications and identifies any missing elements {P, description D, toolset T}. Secondly, the Agent Observer assesses the compatibility of each agent with the task, according to their description information and task content. Finally, the Agent Observer examines the agent list for any redundant or missing roles and eliminates or adds them accordingly.</p><p>After n rounds of bidirectional communication between the Planner and the Agent Observer, the optimal agent list for accomplishing the task is established. Given the vital role of the agent list in the  task execution, this framework employs a predefined agent and multiple rounds of iterative dialogue among multiple agents to finalize the agent list, thereby enhancing the stability and reliability of the execution phase.</p><p>Plan Generation. In parallel to agent generation, the Planner formulates the execution plan and promotes its progressive improvement through reciprocal communication with the Plan Observer. For a given task, the Planner delineates the specific steps {S 1 , S 2 , • • • S n } to accomplish it in the execution plan P . Each step S i entails a clear identification of the agent A j responsible for it, as well as the input information and expected output required for it.</p><p>The Plan Observer subsequently validates the execution plan</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P = {S 1 , S 2 , • • • S n } according to the agent list {A 1 , A 2 , • • • , A n }</formula><p>and the task content. It firstly ensures that each step has a corresponding agent and that the step content is coherent and concise. It secondly assesses whether all the steps are sufficient, whether the task can be accomplished, and whether there are any gaps that need to be filled. It finally provides feedback to the Planner, who further refines the execution plan accordingly. After n rounds of dialogue between the Planner and the Plan Observer, the ultimate execution plan for achieving the task is established.</p><p>Task Execution Actions. The Planner devises an execution plan that automatically assigns the requisite agents for diverse tasks. The execution plan comprises two actions of task execution: selfrefinement by a single agent and collaborative refinement by multiple agents, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="6,498.21,485.07,3.77,8.64" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Self-refinement empowers an individual agent to augment its proficiency in accomplishing some specialized tasks. Collaborative refinement fosters knowledge sharing among multiple agents and achieves tasks requiring interdisciplinary expertise.</p></div>

The communication structures among agents have been investigated by many studies <ref type="bibr" coords="6,229.50,640.97,10.91,8.64" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,243.44,640.97,12.50,8.64" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,258.99,640.97,12.50,8.64" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="6,274.53,640.97,8.36,8.64" target="#b2">3]</ref> to examine their impact on task performance. In this framework, we adopt the vertical communication paradigm, which assigns different tasks to agents according to their roles. To facilitate the specific division of labor among the agents in the generated team, we introduce a predefined Action Observer as the team leader to coordinate the execution plan. Specifically, This mechanism of refinement and communication recurs until the Action Observer attains a unanimous agreement on the execution responses, or the process reaches its maximum iteration limit. For scenarios that demand iterative decision-making towards specific objectives, such as software development, vertical communication would be a preferable option.</p><p>Self-refinement Agent. Besides the inter-agent communication, the performance of a single agent also exerts a significant impact on the overall quality of feedback results. Hence, drawing on mechanisms such as AutoGPT <ref type="bibr" coords="7,233.58,451.60,16.65,8.64" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and ReAct <ref type="bibr" coords="7,297.92,451.60,15.34,8.64" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, we have devised a self-refinement mechanism for an individual agent.</p><p>For a single agent A, the action at step t is at a t = l t ∪ p t ∪ o t , where l t denotes the thought or the reasoning trace in the language space, which does not alter the external environment, and thus yields no observational feedback, p t represents the execution plan for task completion, o t comprises the completion steps and execution output for this time.</p><p>As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="7,205.53,528.01,3.77,8.64" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, various types of useful thoughts can assist in devising a refinement plan. The execution plan enables the agent to anticipate the steps they need to undertake in the future, and the observational content of the execution result construction allows the agent to reevaluate and enhance the plan arrangement, thereby constructing more refined and complete actions. Through a cycle of self-continuous thinking, planning, execution, and feedback, a single agent can effectively execute and accomplish task content.</p><p>Collaborative Refinement Action. In the collaborative refinement action, the agents collaboratively refine and execute the tasks in a sequential manner. Each round of the collaboration involves a fixed order of turn-taking among the agents, who generate their responses based on the current observation. The chat history slot of each agent is updated by concatenating the previous utterances of the other agents. The collaboration terminates automatically when the agents reach a consensus or the maximum number of discussions is reached.</p><p>Knowledge Sharing Mechanism. AutoAgents also facilitates the sharing of execution results among various agents for improved communication and feedback. However, when the number of agents is large and a single agent has more self-iterations, it will generate more historical information. Due to the token limitation of LLM models, they often cannot encompass all information. Hence, this framework provides short-term memory, long-term memory, and dynamic memory.</p><p>Short-term memory is chiefly concentrated on a singular action, encompassing the gamut of intermediary notions, strategies, and outcomes that emerge during the self-refinement or collaborative refinement phases of an individual action. It is salient to note that these actions frequently culminate in a distilled summary of critical information, epitomizing the final phase of the refinement trajectory.</p><p>Long-term memory principally focuses on chronicling the historical trajectory of multifarious actions, predominantly documenting the executed results of each task along with the synthesis of vital feedback information. This aspect is imperative for evaluating the comprehensive extent of task completion.</p><p>Dynamic memory predominantly serves actions necessitating specialized attention. The Action Observer, having access to long-term memory archives, adeptly extracts ancillary information, dynamically tailoring it to the specific requirements of the action for task execution. This process significantly augments the efficiency of a single action in task fulfillment. O agent provides feedback on agent team.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiments</head><p>In order to demonstrate the capabilities and performance of AutoAgents in orchestrating autonomous agent groups to collaboratively accomplish tasks, we have performed extensive quantitative experiments on benchmark tasks and thorough case studies on more complex and realistic applications. In the quantitative analysis, we mainly present results for the Open-ended Question Answer task (detailed in Section 4.1) and the Trivia Creative Writing task (detailed in Section 4.2) to evaluate the framework effectiveness under distinct settings. The Case Studies, discussed in Section 4.4, illustrate the potential of a multi-agent group tackling intricate practical scenarios cooperatively.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation Details:</head><p>We conduct all experiments using the GPT-4 API <ref type="foot" coords="8,406.24,683.37,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_1">4</ref> and set the temperature to 0 to ensure reproducibility. The rationale behind this selection is the exceptional performance these models offer, providing more accurate and standardized output. Additionally, their accessibility and ease of use through APIs enable us to directly call and interact with the models during our research, significantly simplifying the process. The maximum number of discussions during the drafting phase is 3, and the maximum number of self-refinement by a single agent and collaborative refinement by multiple agents during the execution phase is 5.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Open-ended Question Answer</head><p>Task Description. Open-ended Question Answering is a crucial and challenging task in the domain of NLP and generative AI. It requires an AI system to produce coherent, elaborate, and human-like responses to questions that have no predetermined or fixed set of possible answers. <ref type="bibr" coords="9,447.73,184.97,16.70,8.64" target="#b40">[41]</ref> proposed MT-bench, a benchmark consisting of 80 high-quality collected open-ended questions from various categories such as common sense, counterfactual, coding, etc. We then utilize AutoAgents to produce collaborative answers based on multiple generated agents and compare them with the responses given by Vicuna-13B, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. Evaluation Metrics. To measure the quality of open-ended responses with minimal evaluation bias, we adopt FairEval <ref type="bibr" coords="9,189.76,345.62,16.73,8.64" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and HumanEval as the evaluation metrics for both the single agent and AutoAgents. FairEval incorporates several methods to mitigate the impact of various sources of bias, resulting in a better alignment with human judgment. For HumanEval, we enlist several volunteers to rate the responses from different models based on their helpfulness, reliability, accuracy, and level of detail.</p><p>Results. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Trivia Creative Writing</head><p>Task Description. The Trivia Creative Writing task <ref type="bibr" coords="9,312.78,482.41,16.47,8.64" target="#b33">[34]</ref> challenges the capabilities of large language models to retrieve and integrate diverse information from their internal self-compressed knowledge. This task requires a model to craft a coherent story around a given topic while incorporating the answers to N trivia questions. We evaluate the models under two settings, N = 5 and N = 10, where a higher N entails more trivia questions and thus demands the model to exhibit more extensive domain knowledge. We constructed a benchmark consisting of 100 instances for each N , encompassing a total of 1000 trivia questions. Evaluation Metrics. Drawing on the approach of <ref type="bibr" coords="9,322.42,702.61,15.41,8.64" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, we adopt an automatic metric to identify factual errors and measure a model's capacity to integrate diverse domain knowledge. We conduct string matching with the veridical target answers for each question on the generated output. The target answers are supplied from the TriviaQA dataset <ref type="bibr" coords="10,389.46,86.39,15.42,8.64" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and each question can have a list of answer variants. A match to any of the answer variants of a question is regarded as a correct mention. The metric score is calculated as Trivia Creative Writing Metric Score = # correct answer mentions/# trivia questions.</p><p>Results. Table <ref type="table" coords="10,167.40,135.50,4.88,8.64" target="#tab_4">3</ref> demonstrates the superior performance of AutoAgents in knowledge acquisition over the existing methods. Compared to the Standard method, which does not employ Agent Generation, AutoAgents achieves a remarkable 10% improvement across all experiments. Moreover, AutoAgents also surpasses SSP <ref type="bibr" coords="10,184.50,168.23,15.14,8.64" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, which utilizes agent generation but with a different approach. The enhanced performance of AutoAgents can be attributed to its elaborate methods of agent generation discussions and task execution including collaborative refinement and self-refinement. More examples are given in the Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Further Analysis</head><p>This section delves into the significance of key components within AutoAgents by separately analyzing the self-refinement action, collaborative refinement action, dynamic memory, and observers in the draft stage across 20 instances<ref type="foot" coords="10,231.89,265.32,3.49,6.05" target="#foot_2">5</ref> of the Trivia Creative Writing task and additional case studies.  <ref type="bibr" coords="10,168.21,363.70,16.60,8.64" target="#b38">[39]</ref> 66.0 -11.5% SPP-Profile <ref type="bibr" coords="10,197.00,374.61,16.60,8.64" target="#b33">[34]</ref> 74.0 -0.01% SPP <ref type="bibr" coords="10,167.11,385.51,16.60,8.64" target="#b33">[34]</ref> 84.4 +13.1% Collaborative discussion is crucial for rational agent generation and plan allocation. During the Drafting Stage, the Planner in AutoAgents engages in collaborative discussions with two Observers to determine the optimal list of agents and the execution plan. Figure <ref type="figure" coords="10,373.97,493.17,4.96,8.64" target="#fig_4">5</ref> illustrates the contrast between agent generation with and without collaborative discussion. In the absence of Observer feedback, the Planner tends to generate programmers exclusively to accomplish game development, neglecting the holistic process of game creation. With the input and coordination of the Observers, the Planner incorporates game design experts, UI design experts, and testing experts into the agent list. It is evident that the agent generation under collaborative discussions is more comprehensive and more aligned with the realistic scenarios of game development. This also corroborates the significance of collaborative discussions for agent generation and plan allocation, which will subsequently influence the execution outcomes. Concurrently, Table <ref type="table" coords="10,288.37,580.44,4.97,8.64" target="#tab_5">4</ref> elucidates that in the absence of observers, there is a marked 3% reduction in the overall performance of AutoAgents. This substantiates the imperative role of collaborative discussions in agent generation. AutoAgent markedly enhances the caliber of agent generation via collaborative discussions, a facet notably overlooked by other generative frameworks in their consideration of agent generation quality. The empirical data presented in Table <ref type="table" coords="10,499.12,624.08,4.88,8.64" target="#tab_2">2</ref> and 3 further accentuate the superiority of AutoAgents when juxtaposed against counterparts like AgentVerse and SPP.</p><p>Enhancing single-agent through self-refinement. Self-Refinement <ref type="bibr" coords="10,397.28,662.29,15.88,8.64" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,416.90,662.29,12.50,8.64" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,433.14,662.29,7.52,8.64" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,444.40,662.29,7.52,8.64" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,455.66,662.29,12.50,8.64" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,471.89,662.29,13.35,8.64" target="#b39">40]</ref> is a technique that enables LLMs to "converse" with themselves, evaluate their own generation, and iteratively improve their answers. Self-refinement has been shown to enhance the accuracy of LLMs' outputs in various domains <ref type="bibr" coords="10,214.03,695.01,15.65,8.64" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,231.71,695.01,12.40,8.64" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,246.14,695.01,7.42,8.64" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,255.58,695.01,7.42,8.64" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,265.03,695.01,12.40,8.64" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" coords="10,279.46,695.01,11.74,8.64" target="#b39">40]</ref>. Although AutoAgents is a framework for multi-agent  collaboration, it also requires self-refinement agents to perform specialized roles for individual tasks.</p><p>As shown in the results in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,238.21,213.84,3.76,8.64" target="#tab_5">4</ref>, the performance of AutoAgents decreases by 3% in the absence of the self-refinement action. This observation corroborates the assertion that self-refinement is instrumental in augmenting proficiency in trivia creative writing tasks. Furthermore, the enhancement of single agents via self-refinement plays a pivotal role in fortifying the integrity of the overarching multi-agent framework.</p><p>Enhancing multi-agent collaboration through collaborative refinement action. For collaborative refinement, the process resembles the collaborative dialogue mentioned above, which involves integrating knowledge from different domains to accomplish tasks that demand cross-domain knowledge fusion. The results in Table <ref type="table" coords="11,219.35,306.59,4.97,8.64" target="#tab_5">4</ref> demonstrate the performance when collaborative refinement is absent. It's observable that compared to the scenario with AutoAgents, there is a decline of 2%. Since the necessity for multiple agents to collaborate on a single task is entirely dependent on the decision made by the agent in the drafting phase, not all problems necessarily involve tasks that require collaborative refinement. However, it's evident that when this principle is omitted from the prompt's design, there's a noticeable performance decrease.</p><p>Improve the effectiveness of actions by dynamic memory. Dynamic memory predominantly addresses the requisites of specialized agents. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,363.58,388.43,3.66,8.64" target="#fig_3">4</ref>, the Action Observer amalgamates pivotal data for forthcoming tasks, utilizing the historical action records archived in long-term memory. Table <ref type="table" coords="11,133.94,410.25,5.08,8.64" target="#tab_5">4</ref> elucidates a 1% diminution in the efficacy of AutoAgents bereft of dynamic memory. Quintessential insights derived from dynamic memory are assimilated into the prompt, thereby augmenting the comprehension of critical information and bolstering the operational proficiency of actions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Case Study</head><p>To demonstrate the applicability of AutoAgents to more sophisticated and realistic scenarios, we conduct a case study in the software engineering domain. Software engineering is a complex collaborative endeavor that involves diverse roles and responsibilities. From developers who create the underlying code, to UI designers who prioritize user experience, and software testers who ensure the software's quality, experts collaboratively work to enhance and refine the application, ensuring that it meets both functional and user-centric criteria.</p><p>As an illustration in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="11,219.01,560.90,3.80,8.64" target="#fig_5">6</ref>, a Tetris game has been developed by employing AutoAgents, which has generated various expert roles, such as game design expert, UI design expert, programmer, and debugging expert, to accomplish the game development task. The game design experts provide the game logic documents that specify the rules and mechanics of the game. The UI design experts design the UI components that create the visual interface of the game. The programmers implement the game design based on the aforementioned documents and use appropriate programming languages and tools. Finally, the debugging expert tests the game and debuges the program to ensure its functionality and quality. The game development process is based on the collaboration of multiple expert roles, with more elaborate documentation and programs, making it easier for users to comprehend.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>This paper introduces AutoAgents, an innovative framework for automatically synthesizing collaborative specialized agents. AutoAgents mimics the collaborative process of human teams by decomposing tasks into drafting and execution phases and delegating different subtasks to different agents. Our experimental and empirical evaluation validates the advantages of AutoAgents, as it surpasses single agents and other groupings in various tasks that demand diverse skills. Furthermore, our case study in software development illustrates the versatility and potential benefits of our proposed framework.

AutoAgents exhibit remarkable knowledge acquisition and adaptability in tackling complex tasks, but they are not flawless. One of the limitations is that they may still produce erroneous outcomes even with dynamic role generation. This could be ascribed to the rationality of role generation and planning arrangements.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D Prompts</head><p>In this section, we present the prompts of five components in our framework: Planner, Plan Observer, Role Observer, Action Observer, and Custom Agent. These prompts are designed to elicit the desired behaviors and responses from the agents in different scenarios and tasks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>D.1 Planner</head><p>The prompt design principles outlined in the template focus on creating and utilizing specialized LLM-based agent roles to solve complex tasks and problems. Here's a summary of these principles:</p><p>1. Understanding and Breaking Down Tasks: The first step involves comprehensively understanding, analyzing, and deconstructing the given task or problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Utilization of Existing Expert Roles:</head><p>• Fully leverage existing expert roles suited to the problem.</p><p>• Ensure that these roles have cooperative or dependent relationships.</p><p>• Output the details of selected roles in JSON format, including their original information.</p></div>

Finally, based on the content of the problem/task and the expert roles, provide a detailed execution plan with the required steps to solve the problem. 4.1. The execution plan should consist of multiple steps that solve the problem progressively. Make the plan as detailed as possible to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the task. You need to make sure that the summary of all the steps can answer the question or complete the task. 4.2. Each step should assign at least one expert role to carry it out. If a step involves multiple expert roles, you need to specify the contributions of each expert role and how they collaborate to produce integrated results. 4.3. The description of each step should provide sufficient details and explain how the steps are connected to each other. 4.4. The description of each step must also include the expected output of that step and indicate what inputs are needed for the next step. The expected output of the current step and the required input for the next step must be consistent with each other. Sometimes, you may need to extract information or values before using them. Otherwise, the next step will lack the necessary input. 4.5. The final step should always be an independent step that says 'Language Expert: Based on the previous steps, please provide a helpful, relevant, accurate, and detailed response to the user's original question: XXX'. 4.6. Output the execution plan as a numbered list of steps. For each step, please begin with a list of the expert roles that are involved in performing it. the primary responsibility or objective that the expert role aims to achieve. 3.6. You should specify any limitations or principles that each new expert role must adhere to when performing actions. These are called constraints and they must be consistent with the problem requirements and the domain of expertise. 3.7. You should select the appropriate tools that each new expert role needs to use from the existing tool set. Each new expert role can have multiple tools or no tool at all, depending on their functions and needs. You should never create any new tool and only use the existing ones. 3.8. You should provide some helpful suggestions for each new expert role to execute the task effectively and efficiently. The suggestions should include but not limited to a clear output format, extraction of relevant information from previous steps, and guidance for execution steps. 3.9. You should create a prompt template for calling each new expert role according to its name, description, goal, constraints, tools and suggestions. A good prompt template should first explain the role it needs to play (name), its area of expertise (description), the primary responsibility or objective that it aims to achieve (goal), any limitations or principles that it must adhere to when performing actions (constraints), and some helpful suggestions for executing the task (suggestions). The prompt must follow this format: "You are [description], named [name]. Your goal is [goal], and your constraints are <ref type="bibr" coords="25,390.37,554.69,61.18,7.47">[constraints]</ref>. You could follow these execution suggestions: [suggestions].". 3.10. You should always have a language expert role who does not require any tools and is responsible for summarizing the results of all steps in natural language. 3.11. You should follow the JSON blob format for creating new expert roles. Specifically, The JSON of new expert roles should have a 'name' key (the expert role name), a 'description' key (the description of the expert role's expertise domain), a 'tools' key (with the name of the tools used by the expert role), a 'suggestions' key (some suggestions for each agent to execute the task), and a 'prompt' key (the prompt template required to call the expert role). Each JSON blob should only contain one expert role, and do NOT return a list of multiple expert roles. Here is an example of a valid JSON blob: {{{{ "name": "ROLE NAME", "description": "ROLE DESCRIPTONS", "tools": ["ROLE TOOL"], "suggestions": "EXECUTION SUGGESTIONS", </p></div>

Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,353.11,617.93,5.08,8.64">7</ref> depicts the self-refinement process of programmers' coding. They first write a pseudo code file and then generate the corresponding program files based on it. This refinement process significantly ensures the validity of the output file. Although AutoAgents is a framework for multi-agent collaboration, it also requires self-refinement agents to perform specialized roles for individual tasks.</p><p>Improving Teamwork in Multi-Agent Systems with Collaborative Refinement. In collaborative refinement, the method is similar to the team discussions we talked about earlier. This involves bringing together information from various fields to complete tasks that require blending knowledge from different areas. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" coords="14,287.55,713.51,3.75,8.64">8</ref>, during this process, the two agents work together to</p></div>

Building upon the custom agent's framework, a critical aspect of the refinement process is the configuration of 'completed steps' in step 3.1. The specific procedural steps for self-refinement and collaborative refinement are outlined as follows:</p><p>Self-refinement Action: During its first execution, each custom agent omits the outlined step 3.1 and proceeds to complete the remaining steps. If the task's criteria are not met or the step limit has not been reached, the outcomes from this execution are incorporated as 'completed steps' in the prompt for the next iteration of the task. In subsequent executions, the custom agent will execute all steps, continuing this process until the task is deemed successfully completed.</p><p>Collaborative Refinement Action: This mirrors the self-refinement action, yet involves active collaboration between multiple agents. For instance, when agents A and B collaborate on a task, A initially bypasses step 3.1 in its first execution. Upon completion, B incorporates A's results as 'completed steps' and then executes all steps. In later cycles, A and B alternate their roles in the task, perpetuating this collaborative cycle until a joint conclusion is reached.</p></div>			</div>
